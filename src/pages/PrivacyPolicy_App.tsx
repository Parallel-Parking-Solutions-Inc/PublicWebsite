                            Parallel supports in-app QR code scanning to securely start or end parking sessions. When you scan a QR code inside the Parallel app, no external websites are opened, and all payments are processed safely through Parallel's secure systems. In-app scanning also helps confirm that the correct parking lot is selected.

                            Parallel does not process payments, manage sessions, or operate any services through any other domains or third-party apps. If you are redirected to any other website or application, do not provide personal information or make a payment.

                            Users are responsible for verifying the Lot ID, Lot Name, and Lot Address displayed in the app before completing any session or payment, as posted QR codes may be altered in rare cases. Parallel is not responsible for any losses, fraud, or incorrect payments made using modified QR codes or on unauthorized websites.
